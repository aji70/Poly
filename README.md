# 🎲 Tycoon — Monopoly Tycoon on Chain

## Overview

**Tycoon** is an exciting blockchain-\ tycoon game inspired by the classic **Monopoly** board game, built on the **Polygon Network**.  
Players can **buy, sell, and trade virtual properties as NFTs**, collect rent, build monopolies, and compete in a **decentralized on-chain economy**.
